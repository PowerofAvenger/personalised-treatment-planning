# 🏥 AI-Powered Treatment Planning System

A personalized treatment recommendation system that uses machine learning to suggest optimal medical treatments based on patient similarity matching and historical treatment outcomes.

## 🎯 Overview

This system demonstrates how AI can assist healthcare professionals in making data-driven treatment decisions by analyzing patient characteristics and matching them with similar historical cases to predict treatment effectiveness.

**🚨 Important**: This is a proof-of-concept system using synthetic data. It is not intended for actual medical use and should not replace professional medical advice.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 **Patient Similarity Matching**
- Finds patients with similar medical profiles from historical database
- Uses advanced machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity)
- Analyzes 12+ clinical parameters including demographics, lab results, and medical history

### 📊 **Treatment Recommendations**
- Ranks treatments by predicted success rate
- Shows confidence levels based on similar patient outcomes
- Provides evidence-based recommendations with statistical backing

### ⚠️ **Safety & Contraindications**
- Applies clinical safety rules automatically
- Flags potential contraindications based on age, severity, and risk factors
- Highlights important warnings and precautions

### 📈 **Interactive Analytics**
- Visual comparison of treatment success rates
- Patient risk factor assessment
- Real-time insights into treatment patterns

## 🎨 User Interface

- Success probability indicators
- Side effect and contraindication warnings
- Detailed patient profile analysis

### **Analytics & Insights**
- Treatment effectiveness comparisons
- Patient similarity visualizations
- Database overview and statistics

## 🗃️ Dataset

The system uses a synthetic diabetes dataset with:
- **2,000 patient records** with realistic clinical characteristics
- **5 treatment options**: Metformin, Insulin, Sulfonylurea, DPP4 Inhibitors, Lifestyle Modifications
- **Comprehensive features**: Age, BMI, lab results, medical history, lifestyle factors
- **Outcome tracking**: Treatment success rates and side effect profiles

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Web browser for accessing the interface

## 💡 How It Works

### **Step 1: Patient Data Input**
Healthcare professional enters patient information including demographics, lab results, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

### **Step 2: Similarity Analysis**
The system finds the 20 most similar patients from the historical database using machine learning algorithms that consider multiple clinical parameters.

### **Step 3: Treatment Analysis**
For each potential treatment, the system calculates success rates based on outcomes from similar patients, providing statistical confidence levels.

### **Step 4: Safety Screening**
Clinical safety rules are automatically applied to flag contraindications and remove inappropriate treatment options.

### **Step 5: Recommendations**
Treatments are ranked by predicted effectiveness with detailed explanations, success probabilities, and safety considerations.
